# Smart-input-server

A simple server application to translate input from a smartphone onto a computer.  
The concept is simply to use smartphone as an input device for pointer (mouse) and keys (keyboard).

*The server part is done in Clojure because i want to practice with it for a while.*

Could be configured per application and shortcut buttons could be created.  
That is a basic idea for now...

## What's next

For now, Windows plateform is supported for the server.

The client (smart-phone app) will start with Android.  
It'll be another repository, I'll add a link when I have some commits to share.
