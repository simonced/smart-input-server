* Smart-input-server
A simple server application to translate input from a smartphone onto a computer.\\
The concept is simply to use smartphone as an input device for pointer (mouse) and keys (keyboard).

*The server part is done in Clojure because i want to practice with it for a while.*

Could be configured per application and shortcut buttons could be created.\\
That is a basic idea for now...

* Usage
Sample and some usage details.

** Protocol
All signals are transmitted by UDP.

The format is like so:

| signal name | parameters | sample              | explanation                                      |
|-------------+------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------|
| MOUSE_MOVE  | X+n,Y+m    | MOUSE_MOVE:X+10,Y-5 | moves the mouse 10px on X axis, and -5 on Y axis |
| MOUSE_CLICK | 1          | MOUSE_CLICK:1       | press the mouse button 1 (left) then release it  |

For now, only /mouse1/ is handeled.

* What's next
For now, Windows plateform is supported for the server.

The client (smart-phone app) will start with Android.\\
It'll be another repository, I'll add a link when I have some commits to share.
