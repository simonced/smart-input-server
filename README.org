* Smart-input-server
A simple server application to translate input from a smartphone onto a computer.\\
The concept is simply to use smartphone as an input device for pointer (mouse) and keys (keyboard).

/The server part is done in Clojure because i want to practice with it for a while./

Could be configured per application and shortcut buttons could be created.\\
That is a basic idea for now...

* Usage
Sample and some usage details.

** Protocol
All signals are transmitted by UDP.

The format is like so:

| signal name     | parameters | sample              | explanation                                      | Status |
|-----------------+------------+---------------------+--------------------------------------------------+--------|
| MOUSE_MOVE      | X+n,Y+m    | MOUSE_MOVE:X+10,Y-5 | moves the mouse 10px on X axis, and -5 on Y axis | DONE   |
| MOUSE_CLICK (1) | 1          | MOUSE_CLICK:1       | press the mouse button 1 (left) then release it  | DONE   |
| KEY_PRESS (2)   | <a>        | KEY_PRESS:a         | press the key "a" on the keyboard and release it | WIP    |

*(1)* For now, only /mouse1/ is handeled.

*(2)*\\
Key_press can receive modifiers as well like:
- C-c :: means <ctrl> + <c>
- A-d :: means <alt> + <d>
- S-u :: means <shift> + <u>
- C-A-S-s :: means <ctrl> + <alt> + <shift> + <s>

Also, sequence of keys or chords can be sent:
- a b c :: means <a> <b> <c>
- a b C-a :: means <a> <b> <ctrl>+<a>

Can be used for macros in games, complex shortcuts etc...

*NOTE* Please do not use for passwords, because the UDP connexion is not secured.

* What's next
For now, Windows plateform is supported for the server.

The client (smart-phone app) will start with Android.\\
It'll be another repository, I'll add a link when I have some commits to share.
